POSIX-eg is small toolbox of simple POSIX function usage examples.                                                                                                 
The code samples were collected from class notes while teaching system                                                                                             
programming for students of computer sciences and engineering. Some                                                                                                
examples have been useful in graduate and undergraduate disciplines                                                                                                
including Operating Systems, Distributed Systems and Computer Networks.                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                   
POSIX-eg repository includes also some programming exercises.
