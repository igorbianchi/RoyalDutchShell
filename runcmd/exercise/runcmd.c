/* Execute 'command' in a subprocess. Information on the subprocess execution
   is stored in 'result' after its completion, and can be inspected with the
   aid of macros made available for this purpose. Argument 'io' is a pointer
   to an integer vector where the first, second and third positions store
   file descriptors to where standard input, output and error, respective, 
   shall be redirected; if NULL, no redirection is performed. Command line
   must be a string of blank separated arguments as if issued in a command
   line shell. For instance if 'command' is "program arg1 arg2 ... argN",  
   Arguments are parsed and associated to an argv vector such that argv[0]
   points to "program" and argv[N-1] points to "argN".  A member of the
   'exec' family of function is called to execute the program with the
   given arguments in a subprocess created by 'fork'.  Function 'runcmd'
   blocks until the subprocess terminates, unless the last argument in
   'command' starts with '&' (ampersand) character, in which case the 
   supbrocess is executed in parallel with the calling process.  In this 
   case, the function addressed by the global function pointer 
   'runcmd_onexig' is asynchronously called upon the subprocess termination
   (in response to SIGCHLD). If 'runcmd_onexig' points to NULL (default), 
   no action is performed.*/
