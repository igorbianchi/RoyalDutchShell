/* Macros to obtain information on command execution results
   reported by 'runcmd' call.

   IS_NORMTERM(result) returns true if the subprocess has terminated 
                       normally; false otherwise.
   IS_NONBLOCK(result) returns true if the subprocess has been executed
                       in nonblocking mode; false otherwise.
   IS_EXECOK(result)   returns true if 'exec' has been successful in
                       the subprocess; false otherwise.
   EXITSTATUS(result)  returns the exit status returned by the
                       subproccess.

   
   Notice the following. 

   In nonblocking mode, the subprocess's termination mode and exit status 
   are not known. In this case IS_NORMTERM and EXITSTATUS both return zero
   and have no meaning. IS_NONBLOCK may be used for disambiguation.

   In blocking mode if 'exec' has failed, the exit status must be that of 
   the (unmodified) subprocess itself. In this case, the subprocess terminates
   successfully with exit status 127; IS_EXECOK may be used for disambiguation.

   In blocking mode with successful 'exec' execution, if termination is
   abnormal the process' exit status is unknown. In this case, EXIT_STATUS
   returns zero and has no meaning. IS_NORMTERM may be used for disambiguation.
