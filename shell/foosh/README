OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------

Foosh - The Foo Shell

Foosh is a minimal bolierplate for a shell command line interpreter.

The example reads strings from the standard input and parse it.

No command execution is actually performand.

Foosh implements the trivial command line grammar defined by libtparser.

Implementation of pipeline execution is left as an exercise.
