OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------

Foosh - The Foo Shell

Foosh is a minimal bolierplate for a shell command line interpreter.

The example reads strings from the standard input and parse it.

No command execution is actually performand.

Foosh implements the trivial command line grammar defined by libtparser.

Implementation of pipeline execution is left as an exercise.

INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------

THIS IS A PROVISIONAL PIECE OF INFORMATION.
PLEASE, BE AWARE OF UPDATES.

Follow the same rules of exercise runcmd!

   Your implementation must use **exclusively** the standard C library (aka libc)
   and no other external library. This is part of the execise.

   The implementation must be adherent to standards ISO/ANSI/Standard C (c89/90)
   and POSIX (IEEE 1003.1-2008). The evaluation of the exercise will be performed
   by compiling your library with

   gcc -Wall -Werror --ansi --pedantic-errors -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200809L

Please, keep an eye on the FAQ (to be extended)

   Q: Should my shell be named foosh?
   A: For God, no! 

   Q: May my shell be more complex than foosh specs?
   A: Sure.

   Q: Must I use libtparse?
   A: No.

   Q: May I use libtparse?
   A: Yes. In this case, consider it installed in the users system.
 
   Q: May I use bison/yacc for the parser?
   A: Yes.
