POSIX-eg is small toolbox of simple POSIX programming examples.

The code samples were collected from class notes while teaching system
programming for students of computer sciences and engineering. Some
examples have been useful in graduate and undergraduate disciplines
including Operating Systems, Distributed Systems and Computer Networks.

POSIX-eg repository includes also some programming exercises.
