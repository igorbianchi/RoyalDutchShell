OVERVIEW
--------

POSIX-eg is small collection of simple POSIX programming examples.

Code samples were collected from class notes while teaching system
programming for students of computer sciences and engineering. Some
examples have been useful in graduate and undergraduate disciplines
including Operating Systems, Computer Architecture, Distributed Systems
and Computer Networks.

POSIX-eg repository includes also some programming exercises.

The project can be found at https://gitlab.com/monaco/posixeg

QUICK START
-----------

After either cloning POSIXeg from the Git repository or unpacking a
distribution tarball, build the project by invoking of the provided
GNU build system's scripts:

    $ cd <somepath>/posixeg
    $ ./configure
    $ make

POSIXeg content is organized in directories:

* posixeg/examples   	 with varying source code examples;
* posixeg/exercises	 with proposed programming exercises;
* posixeg/instructions	 with directions for students and instructors;
* posixeg/tools		 with miscellaneous utilities;
* posixeg/doc		 with the project documentation;
* posixeg/extras	 with some non-strict POSIX add-ons.

Unlike the usual Autotools approach, POSIXeg build scripts are not configured to
automatically compile all software packages at once. Instead, the aforementioned
steps will solely generate the needed Makefiles.  Each specific piece of
software shall be individually build, and optionally installed, by entering
the respective directory and issuing the appropriate building command:

   $ cd <relevant-directory>
   $ make

For instance, to build programs under posixeg/examples/snippets:

   $ cd <somepath>/posixeg/examples/snippets
   $ make

All other GNU build system's standard targets are available as usual.

It is possible to build the entire project at once by issuing

   $ make force-all

from the project's top source directory.

File posixeg/INSTALL contains detailed building and installation instructions.

NEXT STEPS
----------

Both instructors and students may refer to directory 'instructions' for
detailed information on how to use the package contents for teaching/learning
POSIX concepts, including a guide for available examples, as well as directions
for practicing and verifying proposed programming exercises.

The package offer several illustration of POSIX programming ranging from minimal
self-contained code excerpts to more sophisticated stand-alone applications
and library demonstrations.  These may be found under directory 'examples'.

Included with the software, under directory 'exercises' there are also some
programming exercises intended for students and instructors interested in
practicing the concepts and examples.  Specific instructions are offered
when applicable.

Directory 'tools' contain some miscellaneous utilities which may be of use
for practicing the programming exercises and in general. Also included, under
directory 'extras', are a few non-strict POSIX, yet interesting, examples and
tools which may come in handy for common practical situations.

Finally, please, refer to documents in directory 'doc' for further directions
on both installing the software and contributing to the project.
